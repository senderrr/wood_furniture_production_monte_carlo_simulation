## Title: Wood Furniture Production Monte Carlo Simulation

## Team Members: Alex Wieker
Summary: In this simulation, I will be simulating if daily orders are completed in a timely fashion for a small business that constructs custom wood furniture. The variables that I will be working with include what items were included in any received orders (some items take longer to make and some orders will have smaller or larger quantities of items ordered), and the time it takes to switch machinery between working on different items that may require different machinery. Lastly, there will be two types of simulations run. The first where orders are only worked on after a previous order has finished (first come first serve). The second being where orders that contain similar items will be worked on in tandem instead of only working on one order at a time. Hypothesis: I hypothesize that more orders  will be completed on time if orders that contain similar items are completed in tandem instead of only working on one order at a time.
