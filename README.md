## Title: Wood Furniture Production Monte Carlo Simulation

## Team Members: Alex Wieker

## Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: 
In this simulation, I will be simulating two scenarios for a small manufactory that produces wooden furniture in order to determine which of the scenarios makes the furniture available to their customers faster. In my scenarios, I am starting  day 1 as the first work day, and they begin to work on orders that were processed from the day  before.  Hence, all customers wait at least one day froms sending the other and their order being available.
 # Scenario 1: First Come First Queue
if daily orders are completed in a timely fashion for a small business that constructs custom wood furniture. The variables that I will be working with include what items were included in any received orders (some items take longer to make and some orders will have smaller or larger quantities of items ordered), and the time it takes to switch machinery between working on different items that may require different machinery. Lastly, there will be two types of simulations run. The first where orders are only worked on after a previous order has finished (first come first serve). The second being where orders that contain similar items will be worked on in tandem instead of only working on one order at a time. 

## Hypothesis: 
I hypothesize that the inventory stock queue will result in orders have less wait time between the order customer making the order and the order being built than the first come first servue queue.  

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes? What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
